        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="description">
            I'm a product leader with a passion for building software that solves real business problems. Over the past decade, I've worked across fintech, healthcare tech, and enterprise SaaS, leading cross-functional teams to deliver products that users actually love.
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            I started my career as a software developer, which gave me the technical foundation to bridge the gap between engineering teams and business stakeholders. These days, I spend most of my time talking to customers, analyzing data, and working with designers and engineers to ship features that move the needle.
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            Outside of work, I'm an avid runner and have completed 5 marathons. I also volunteer with Code for America, helping civic organizations leverage technology to serve their communities better.
        </div>
        <div class="description">
            I believe the best products come from diverse teams who listen to users, iterate quickly, and aren't afraid to kill features that aren't working. If you're building something interesting in the B2B space, I'd love to connect!
