My name is John Doe. I'm a product manager, former software developer, and lifelong learner. I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, but I've lived in several cities including New York, Boston, and now San Francisco.

I'm a huge coffee enthusiast and I've been on a quest to find the perfect espresso in every city I've lived in. I own way too many coffee brewing devices - French press, Aeropress, pour-over, and a fancy espresso machine I probably don't know how to use properly. On weekends, you'll often find me trying out new coffee shops or attempting latte art at home (with mixed results).

I'm also passionate about running. I completed my first marathon in 2019 and haven't looked back. There's something meditative about long runs - it's where I do my best thinking about product problems and life in general.
